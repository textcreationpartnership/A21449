            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Touching Victuals, we finde ingroſsing to bee a great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to raiſe the prices thereof, an offence vtterly againſt the Common-Law: And amongſt ingroſſers, we finde the Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to bee great offenders in buying great quantities of all ſorts of Graine brought vnto,
<pb facs="tcp:680:5"/>or towards the Market.</p>
            <p>We alſo find, that Tauernes are of late exceedingly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their number, in, &amp; about <hi>London,</hi> and that they dreſſe Fleſh, &amp; Fiſh, &amp; vtter the ſame at exceſsiue prices, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Riot, and other abuſes; whereas by the Law, as Tauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are to ſell nothing but Wine, vnleſſe it bee Bread to eate therewith.</p>
            <p>We find, that Bakers doe ſell their bread, at foureteene, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, and ſixeteene to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, where they ſhould keepe the Aſsize, and not ſell aboue twelue, or thirteene at the moſt to the dozen; and this pincheth the poore.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:680:5"/>
            <p> Wee wiſh that Ordinaries in and about <hi>London</hi> may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated to a conuenient ſumme, not to exceede two ſhillings for a meale. And wee wiſh that both Tauerners and Ordinary-keepers may bee wholly reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſuffering vnlawfull Games in their houſes; for wee find that this drawes vnthriftie gueſts vnto them, and is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent meanes to ouerthrow the fortunes of many Gentlemen and Citizens.</p>
            <p>Touching Horſe-meat, vpon hearing of diuers Iuſtices of Peace of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> and of diuers Inkeepers of <hi>London, Weſtminſter, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> wee are of opinion
<pb facs="tcp:680:6"/>that the preſent prices of Hay and Oats conſidered, ſixe pence day and night for Hay for a Horſe, and for Oats ſixe pence a pecke <hi>Wincheſter</hi> meaſure, is a competent Rate to be taken by Inholders, and to take nothing for litter; and if they exceede theſe Rates, we hold them pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the Law, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting exceſsiue and vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prices.</p>
            <p>For Horſes which come to Innes in the day time, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be a conuenient Rate for the Inne-keeper to take a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for a Horſe for his Stable-roome, onely the Horſe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnbridled; if he be vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and haue Hay and goe away
<pb facs="tcp:680:6"/>the ſame day, to take two pence the horſe and no more.</p>
            <p>We finde that of late yeeres there are many petty Oſtries ſet vp in and about <hi>London,</hi> which entertaine Horſes in by-corners, and receiue Stable-horſes, and the Horſes of ſuch who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuſpected, and theſe haue no lodging for trauellers. By theſe Oſtries great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences happen to the Subiect in generall, and much preiudice to the Inholders in particular, who by Law are bound to lodge their gueſts, and to be anſwerable for the goods brought into their charge.</p>
            <p>Wee finde alſo that there are diuers who vnlawfully ingroſſe
<pb facs="tcp:680:7"/>great quantity of Hay to ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; theſe are ingroſſers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the Common Law; And humbly mooued this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Court, that the ſame might bee heere recorded, and that the Court would be pleaſed for the good of His Maieſties people, to Decree and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be ſtrictly obſerued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this honourable Court ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame into their ſerious conſideration, hath ordered that the ſaid Certificate be recorded in this Honourable Court, And hath Decreed;</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that it is notoriouſly knowen that ingroſsing is a great occaſion to raiſe the prices
<pb facs="tcp:680:7"/>of victuall, and alſo of Hay, and ingroſsing to inhance prices is puniſhable not onely by the Statutes, but alſo by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawes of the Realme; His Maieſties Iuſtices of the Benches at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Aſsize; and Oyer and Terminer, and Iuſtices of Peace in their ſeuerall places are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cauſe diligent enquiry to bee made of all ingroſſers of all ſorts of victuall and Hay, and ſee the Delinquents herein bee ſeuerely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And His Maieſties Attorney generall, is likewiſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cauſe ſuch of them as ſhal be brought to his notice, to bee
<pb facs="tcp:680:8"/>informed againſt in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Court, that of them example may bee made, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre others from like offence.</p>
            <p>And it is Decreed, that after publication of this Decree in <hi>London,</hi> no Chandler preſume to buy Corne, Graine, Meale, or Flower to ſell againe, either in Market, or out of Market.</p>
            <p>And this Court concurring in opinion with the ſaid Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Iudges, and conſidering the great exceſſe and ryot that is occaſioned by preparing and ſelling of Victuall in Tauernes, and how the prices of ſundry ſorts of Viands are hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: Hath decreed that no Tauernour or Vintner, ſelling
<pb facs="tcp:680:8"/>Wine by Retaile, doe hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſell or make ready for ſale, any ſort of Fleſh or Fiſh, or other Victuall, ſaue Bread, nor to defraud this Ordinance, doe by himſelfe or any other ſet vp, or cauſe, or procure to be ſet vp the Trade of a Cooke within the ſame houſe, or in any ſhop or roome therunto belonging, or in any houſe thereto neere adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, nor permit or ſuffer any Fleſh, Fiſh, or other Victuall, except bread, as aforeſaid, to be brought into his houſe to be there eaten by any of his Gueſts.</p>
            <p>And the Court taking into conſideration, how the poore are oppreſſed and pinched, when Bakers doe ſell their Bread
<pb facs="tcp:680:9"/>to thoſe that vent the ſame by Retaile at the Rates of more then twelue to the dozen, in that the weight is abated in euery loafe, and the Buyer being ſome times but a Paſſenger, is not able to make complaint of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whom he knoweth not; It is therefore likewiſe ordered and decreed, that no Baker ſhall ſell any Bread at other Rate then twelue or thirteene at the moſt for the dozen.</p>
            <p>And further it is decreed that none that ſhall keepe Ordinary Tables, or other Victualling Tables, ſhall take more of the Gueſts, then after the Rate of two ſhillings the man for the Meale, nor more then eight-pence
